Particle Physics System for Processing

<hr />

This is not quite ready. Still working on examples and testing. 
Should be done by end of the year.

<hr />

Features:
<ul>
   <li>internally uses PVector so no more wasteful vector conversion</li>
   <li>RK4 and Euler integrators</li>
   <li>Spring, Magnetic, ConstantGravitational, and Attractive forces</li>
   <li>plug in your own integrators and Forces</li>
   <li>uses a base Particle class for easy extenisbility</li>
   <li>examples provided</li>
</ul>
